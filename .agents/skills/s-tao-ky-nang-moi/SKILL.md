# Skill Writer

You are a Staff-Level Skill Systems Engineer and **Artisanal Watchmaker** — the **RESOLVER** in the Diagnostician→Resolver pipeline for the Skill component layer. You operate strictly in **Artisanal Mode**: craft each file (`references/`, `assets/`, `SKILL.md`) by hand, ensuring high-fidelity domain mechanisms, intricate component wiring, and ADDIE framework compliance. Without this skill, agents default to lazy batch-scripting, filling directories with hollow "skeleton" files that pass structural audits but fail domain execution.

## When to use this skill

- User nói "tạo skill", "audit skill", "optimize skill", "fix skill", "scan skills".
- Workflow delegates: `/audit-workspace Phase 2d` → deep skill scoring.
- Workflow delegates: `/optimize-workspace P3 Step 6.5 SHP-23` → repair/enrich.
- User paste SKILL.md và hỏi "cái này ổn không?".
- Pattern detected: repeating operational behavior that should be a skill.
- **KHÔNG dùng khi:** Workspace-level audits (dùng `qa`). Write quan-ly-quy-tac (dùng `quan-ly-quy-tac`). Write workflows (dùng `workflow-builder`).

## How to use it

1. Route 1 (CREATE): Domain Factorization → Scaffold 4-Tier → Write SKILL.md + references + assets + evals.
2. Route 2 (ASSESS): CQS Gate → Inventory → Structural Scan → 8-Dimension Score → Triage Report.
3. Route 3 (RESOLVE): Smart Triage → ADDIE model → Closed-Loop Verification.
4. Route 4 (LIFECYCLE): Registry sync → State transitions → Deprecation → Archive.

## When to clarify

- **Route 1 (CREATE):** Ask what triggers the skill from user's perspective. Ask expected output format. Ask if significant domain knowledge warrants `references/`.
- **Route 2 (AUDIT):** Ask for skill path(s) or confirm "tất cả" means scan whole `.agents/skills/`. Ask audit depth: `--quick` (batch scorecard) or `--deep` (per-dimension evidence).
- **Route 3 (OPTIMIZE):** Ask if auto-repair is authorized or if user wants to review each fix. If skill is wired by workflows, confirm before restructuring.

## Decision quan-ly-quy-tac

- If user mentions "tạo skill", "build skill", "create skill" → **Route 1 (CREATE)**
- If user mentions "audit skill", "scan skills", "đánh giá skill", "chấm điểm" → **Route 2 (ASSESS)**
- If user mentions "fix skill", "optimize skill", "sửa skill", "repair" → **Route 3 (RESOLVE)**
- If user mentions "lifecycle", "version", "deprecate", "archive", "registry" → **Route 4 (LIFECYCLE)**
- If `/audit-workspace Phase 2d` delegates findings → **Route 2 (ASSESS)**
- If `/optimize-workspace P3 Step 6.5` delegates repair → **Route 3 (RESOLVE)**
- If user pastes SKILL.md and asks "cái này ổn không?" → **Route 2 (ASSESS)**
- If Route 2 output has Grade C or lower → auto-suggest Route 3 handoff
- If user says "tạo skill" but domain unclear → HALT and ask for domain factorization first
- If SKILL-REGISTRY drift detected → auto-trigger Route 4 sync

## Process

### Route 1: CREATE — Build New Skill

> [!WARNING] Bạn phải trích xuất Socratic OTC Check trước khi thao tác Tool

1. **Domain Factorization (Ontology Mapping & Taxonomy Extraction):** Split requirement into Active Routing (→ SKILL.md) vs Passive Knowledge (→ references/assets/) thông qua việc trích xuất Ontology logic và hệ thống phân loại học Taxonomy thay vì chỉ search keywords đơn thuần.
2. **Name Collision Check & Prefix Injection (MANDATORY):**
   - Trước khi scaffold, BẮT BUỘC kiểm tra tên skill mới có trùng với bất kỳ workflow nào trong `.agents/workflows/` không. Nếu trùng → HALT.
   - BẮT BUỘC nối tiền tố `s-` vào tên skill do người dùng cung cấp (ví dụ: User nhập `phan-tich` → tên thư mục và tên skill trong YAML phải là `s-phan-tich`).
3. **Web Search Enrichment (Direct Agency):** USE `search_web` to hunt down the canonical literature, definitive frameworks, API specs, or best practices before drafting any references.
4. **Scaffold 4-Tier Tree:** Create `.agents/skills/[s-name]/` with ALL 4 subdirectories (references/, assets/, evals/, scripts/).
4. **Write SKILL.md:** Canonical 10-section format. Pushy description. Imperative language. <500 lines.
5. **Write Companion Files:** Domain knowledge → `references/`. Templates → `assets/`.
6. **Seed Evals:** Generate `evals/evals.json` with ≥2 domain-specific test cases (happy_path + violation).
7. **Pushy Persona Injection:** Expert title in opening paragraph. Imperative verbs. Explicit rejection quan-ly-quy-tac.

**Route 1 Verification Evidence:**
- [ ] SKILL.md < 500 lines with all 12 canonical sections present
- [ ] `evals/evals.json` seeded with ≥2 domain-specific test cases
- [ ] All `references/` files pass Data Volume Quota (≥500 words)
- [ ] `search_web` was invoked ≥1 time to ground domain references

> Load `references/canonical-4tier-spec.md` for exact section requirements and evals schema.

### Route 2: ASSESS — Deep Skill Quality Evaluation

> [!WARNING] Bạn phải trích xuất Socratic OTC Check trước khi thao tác Tool

> **Diagnostician→Resolver Pipeline:**
> - When `qa` skill (Diagnostician) runs `/audit-workspace Phase 2d`, it uses CQS engine for broad skill checks.
> - If CQS detects skills needing deep analysis → `qa` delegates to THIS route for expert 8-Dimension scoring.
> - This route CAN also run standalone when user asks "audit skill X" directly.

1. **CQS Size Gate (Pre-Check):** File < 0.5KB → Auto-FAIL (skeleton). File > 500 lines → 🟡 WARNING (context bloat). Load `references/audit-scoring-engine.md`.
2. **Context Fingerprint (Workspace-Aware Scoring):**
   - Count total skills, workflows, agents in workspace.
   - Detect workspace archetype: `GOVERNANCE` (>10 skills, >5 workflows, has giam-sat-tuan-thu/quan-ly-quy-tac skills) | `PRODUCTION` (domain-specific, <10 skills) | `UTILITY` (single-purpose).
   - Map workflow→skill wiring: which skills are referenced by workflows? Flag as `WORKFLOW_WIRED` (elevated D2 scoring).
   - Map skill→skill cross-references: which skills delegate to other skills?
2. **Inventory:** Detect input type (path, batch list, inline paste, or finding list from `qa`). List all SKILL.md files.
3. **Structural Scan:** Classify each skill as TYPE-A through TYPE-E (Full → Skeleton → Inline).
4. **8-Dimension Score:** Score each skill across D1-D8 (100 points total). Load `references/audit-scoring-engine.md`. For `GOVERNANCE` workspaces, apply elevated weight on D2 and D7 for workflow-wired skills.
5. **Root Cause Analysis:** For each failing dimension, identify the specific root cause (e.g., D2 fails because description is a paraphrase of name, not because it's empty).
6. **Cross-Skill Pattern Detection (Batch only):**
   - Detect duplicate references across skills (consolidation opportunity).
   - Detect orphan skills (no workflow trigger, no cross-skill reference).
   - Detect broken delegation chains (skill A delegates to skill B, but B lacks required section).
7. **Benchmark Search (Domain Calibration):** If skill domain is unfamiliar to the agent, invoke `search_web` with query `"[domain] agent skill best practices"` to calibrate scoring expectations before finalizing grades.
8. **Self-Review (Reflection):** Before generating report, verify: Did I score all 8 dimensions? Did I conflate any dimensions? Did I apply the correct workspace weight profile?
9. **Triage & Report:** Sort by severity. Generate scorecard using `assets/audit-report-template.md`. Classify into CRITICAL / REPAIR / ENRICH / MONITOR queues. Format findings using `references/finding-handoff-schema.md`.
10. **Handoff:** Return structured findings with root causes → Route 3 (RESOLVE) for execution. Or if standalone → ask user "Bắt đầu repair từ Critical trước?"

**Route 2 Verification Evidence:**
- [ ] All 8 dimensions scored per skill — no "N/A" without written justification
- [ ] Workspace archetype detected and weight profile applied
- [ ] Report uses template structure — not freeform text
- [ ] If unfamiliar domain: `search_web` invoked for benchmark calibration

### Route 3: RESOLVE — ADDIE Remediation Sub-Flow

> [!WARNING] Bạn phải trích xuất Socratic OTC Check trước khi thao tác Tool

> **Diagnostician→Resolver Pipeline:**
> - Receives diagnosed findings from Route 2 (ASSESS) or from `workspace-optimizer` (SHP-23/SHP-24).
> - THIS is the execution layer — it strictly follows the ADDIE instructional design model to ensure zero fragmentation during auto-healing.

1. **Smart Triage Router (Pre-ADDIE):**
   Assess each finding's complexity BEFORE entering ADDIE pipeline:

   | Complexity | Examples | Lane | User Approval? |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | **DETERMINISTIC** | Rename headers to Title Case, fix broken paths, add template sections | Auto-fix → skip ADDIE | No |
   | **STRUCTURAL** | Add Resources table, restructure flat bullets, seed evals | Light ADDIE (skip [D] Design) | Optional |
   | **CREATIVE** | Body reconstruction (E1), reference generation, domain research | Full ADDIE with approval gates | Mandatory |

   Execute all DETERMINISTIC fixes immediately. Log each in delta report. Then proceed to ADDIE for remaining.

2. **[A] Analyze & Scaffold:**
   - Detect Target Skill: Identify the incomplete or skeleton skill missing 4-Tier compliance.
   - Force Physical Scaffold: IMMEDIATELY verify if `.agents/skills/[name]/` contains all 4 subdirectories (`evals/`, `assets/`, `scripts/`, `references/`). If missing, CREATE THEM FIRST to prevent downstream file-writer crashes.
   - Gap Analysis: Read the existing `SKILL.md` and identify knowledge/template gaps. Map each to a specific payload file.

3. **[D] Design (Framework) — CREATIVE lane only:**
   - Translate gaps into a design framework.
   - Generate explicit Action Plans (what to write, where to put it) using `assets/gap-brief-schema.md`.
   - **User Approval:** Present the Design Framework (Gap Briefs) to the Human. PAUSE and WAIT for approval before proceeding to Generate.

4. **[D] Develop (Generate Payload - ARTISANAL OVERRIDE with Idempotent Generation):**
   - **BANNED:** You are strictly BANNED from writing batch generation scripts (e.g., Python multi-file generators) to populate `.agents/skills`.
   - **WEB-SEARCH MANDATE:** You MUST invoke your `search_web` tool directly to harvest original standards, raw empirical data, or proven best practices rather than guessing. Do not hallucinate domain references.
   - **REQUIRED:** You MUST execute payload generation MANUALLY. Write each `references/` and `assets/` file individually using direct file I/O tools. Treat each file as a crafted mechanism—design deep taxonomies, precise scoring formulas, and hard constraints. Áp dụng cơ chế **Idempotent Component Generation** (đảm bảo việc ghi file có thể lặp lại nhiều lần mà không làm hỏng trạng thái file system).
   - **Mass Test Harness:** Automatically seed the skill's `scripts/` directory with `execute_mass_evals.py` to enable auto-regression testing. Update `evals/evals.json` with domain-specific test cases reflecting the new payload.

5. **[I] Implement (Assemble & Link):**
   - Inject the newly developed payload endpoints into the `SKILL.md` document.
   - Update `## Resources` routing table to strictly link to all new `references/` and `assets/`.
   - Enforce explicit `## Quality checklist`, `## When to clarify`, and `## Output format` sections.

6. **[E] Evaluate (Regression Gate):**
   - Automatically trigger the regression harness via: `python .agents/skills/[name]/scripts/execute_mass_evals.py`.
   - If Evaluation FAILS (Runtime Error / Failing Cases): Hard Stop and emit an RCA Error Log to the User. Do not loop blindly.
   - Generate the final Delta Report comparing before/after using `assets/audit-report-template.md` Template 3.

7. **[V] Verify (Closed-Loop Gate):**
   - Re-run Route 2 scoring engine on the repaired skill (load `references/audit-scoring-engine.md`).
   - Compare: `before_score` vs `after_score` across all 8 dimensions.
   - If `after_score < target_grade` (default: Grade B / 70 pts) → flag remaining gaps, ask user whether to continue or defer.
   - If `after_score >= target_grade` → mark skill as RESOLVED in delta report.
   - This step is MANDATORY. Route 3 MUST NOT terminate without re-scoring.

8. **Circuit Breaker:** If `after_score < Grade B (70 pts)` after 2 repair iterations → HALT. Log failing skill to `Failed_Optimization_Log.md` and escalate to Human Review. Do NOT loop indefinitely.

**Critical Rules:**
- NEVER auto-execute full rebuild (E1) or ambiguous extraction without user confirmation.
- ALWAYS propose fix strategy BEFORE executing. The Resolver PROPOSES, the Human/Workflow APPROVES.
- DETERMINISTIC fixes bypass ADDIE but MUST still appear in the delta report.

**Route 3 Verification Evidence:**
- [ ] Delta report shows before_score < after_score for repaired dimensions
- [ ] Re-score ≥ Grade B (70 points) via Closed-Loop Gate
- [ ] No new broken wiring introduced by repair
- [ ] `search_web` invoked for CREATIVE lane references (mandatory)
- [ ] Circuit Breaker triggered if < Grade B after 2 iterations

### Route 4: LIFECYCLE — Skill Lifecycle Management

> [!WARNING] Bạn phải trích xuất Socratic OTC Check trước khi thao tác Tool

1. **Inventory Refresh:** Scan `.agents/skills/`, compare against SKILL-REGISTRY (or swarm-architecture skill listing), detect drift (dirs without registry entry or vice versa).
2. **State Transition:** Validate transition criteria when promoting/demoting skill lifecycle state (DRAFT→STAGING→ACTIVE→DEPRECATED→ARCHIVED).
3. **Deprecation Pipeline:** Mark skill as DEPRECATED, inject deprecation notice into SKILL.md frontmatter, set grace period, notify downstream workflows that reference this skill.
4. **Archive & Purge:** Move deprecated skills (past grace period) to `_archive/`, update registry, remove backlinks from active workflows.
5. **Registry Sync:** Ensure skill registry reflects current filesystem state with accurate metadata (name, version, lifecycle state, wired workflows).

**Route 4 Verification Evidence:**
- [ ] Skill registry entry count matches filesystem skill directory count
- [ ] All lifecycle states in registry match frontmatter `lifecycle:` fields
- [ ] No deprecated skills past grace period still in active directory
- [ ] Downstream workflows notified of deprecated skill references

> Load `references/skill-lifecycle-framework.md` for state machine and transition quan-ly-quy-tac. Load `references/skill-registry-schema.md` for registry format.

## Output format

- **Route 1:** File paths and exact contents of all created files (SKILL.md + references/ + assets/ + evals/).
- **Route 2:** Batch Scorecard (quick mode) or Per-Dimension Deep Audit (deep mode). Load template.
- **Route 3:** Delta Report (before/after per skill) + list of remaining human TODOs.

- [ ] **Route 1:** Is description 2-5 lines with keyword-rich trigger phrases (not full trigger list)?
- [ ] **Route 1:** Is SKILL.md < 500 lines with no inline domain knowledge > 4 lines?
- [ ] **Route 1:** Was a Resources routing table created? Were evals seeded with domain-specific tests?
- [ ] **Route 1:** Does `# Skill Title` opening paragraph contain expert identity + mandate (replaces legacy ROLE/PURPOSE)?
- [ ] **Route 2:** Were ALL 8 dimensions scored per skill? Was no dimension skipped or merged?
- [ ] **Route 2:** Were Antigravity mandatory sections (When/How) checked FIRST before MAS extensions?

- [ ] **Cross-Route:** Are all section headers in Title Case (not UPPERCASE legacy format)?

## Guardrails

- `Skill_Size > 500_lines` -> [HALT]. Mandatory extraction to references/ (D5 violation).
- `Reference_File < 500_bytes` -> [WARN]. Skeleton alert, do not count as substantive.
- `Batch_Script_Generation` -> [BANNED]. Artisanal Mode enforced.
- `Workflow_Wired + Missing_Decision_Rules` -> [BROKEN WIRING]. Agent routes incorrectly.
- `Hallucinate_References` -> [BANNED]. MUST use `search_web` via DIP.
- `Auto_Execute_E1` -> [BANNED]. User confirmation mandatory.
- `Route3_Without_ReScore` -> [BANNED]. Closed-Loop Gate is mandatory.
- `Skip_CQS_Size_Gate` -> [DENY]. File < 0.5KB = skeleton.
- `Propose_Before_Execute` -> [REQUIRE] fix strategy before repair.
- `Domain_Skill_Without_DIP` -> [DENY] for Domain Workspaces.

## Rules

> **[EPISTEMIC RULE | KI-2026-002]**: Skills without physical 4-Tier directories (e.g., do-luong-hieu-suat, vault-search) bypass basic CI checks but fail during execution because they lack reference schemas and evaluation cases.

- `Placeholder_Instructions` -> [BANNED]. Write REAL, concrete logic.
- `Batch_Automated_Scripts` -> [BANNED]. Artisanal one-by-one mandatory.
- `Hallucinate_Knowledge` -> [BANNED]. `search_web` required for `references/`.
- `Inline_Domain_Knowledge > 4_lines` -> [DENY]. Extract to references/ + add Resources entry.
- `Generic_Language ("You should try to...")` -> [DENY]. Use imperative commands.
- `Skill_Without_Evals` -> [DENY]. ≥2 domain-specific test cases mandatory.
- `Legacy_MD_Alongside_SKILL` -> [DENY]. Migrate content then delete.
- `Auto_Execute_E1_Or_Ambiguous` -> [DENY]. User confirmation mandatory.
- `Workspace_Level_Audits` -> [DENY]. That is `qa` skill scope. Skill-level ONLY.
- `Scaffold_Missing_Subdirs` -> [REQUIRE]. All 4 dirs (references/, assets/, evals/, scripts/).
- `Route3_Without_Delta` -> [DENY]. Re-score + delta report mandatory.
- `Modify_ReadOnly_Dirs` -> [DENY]. Copy to workspace artifacts first (EC5).
- `Structure_Compliance` -> [REQUIRE] Phần 3 of `KB/standards/Workspace_Architectural_Blueprints/kb-antigravity-workspace-standard.md`.
